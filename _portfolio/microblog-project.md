# Description of Project

The goal of this project is to be able to create a blogging platform for users to create and share posts.  The tutorial that I followed to create this project can be found [here](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).  My build process for this project is split into multiple posts.  

One of my takeaways from this project is a computer science principle called 'separation of concerns'.  This is a principle that I realized that I always adhered to in my previous projects.  The separation of concerns principle is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, each in charge of a separate concern.  A concern here is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program or software functionality.  The author utilized this principle throughout the tutorial, creating scripts that handled different areas or problems when it comes to building a microblog.  The following links will guide you through my creation process for this project:
