# Description of Project

The goal of this project is to be able to create a blogging platform for users to
create and share posts.  The tutorial that I followed to create this project can be found [here](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).  
My build process for this project is split into multiple posts.  The following links
will guide you through my creation process for this project: 

[Part One: Creating the login, logoff, and registration forms along with the backend database for users.]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-08-06-microblog-part-one %})
