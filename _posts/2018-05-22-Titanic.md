# Analyzing the Sinking of the titanic

On April 14th, 1912, the RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg and sunk during the morning hours
of the 15th.  Thought to be unsinkable, the Titanic did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers.
On September 28th, 2012, Kaggle introduced the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" challenge.
The challenge was simple: find out what sorts of people were likely to survive.

As this is my first machine learning/data science project, I am following along another users
kernel to step through and see what I can figure out. Here is a [link](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions)
to Manav Sehgal's solution.
